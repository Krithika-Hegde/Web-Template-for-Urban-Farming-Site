                <span class="v1_29">Urban gardening is where people practice cultivation, mainly of food, in and around urban areas. Basically, it is the traditional cultivation of crops, but in urban centers.

                <span class="v1_30">Hydroponics is the technique of growing plants using a water-based nutrient solution rather than soil, and can include an aggregate substrate, or growing media, such as vermiculite, coconut coir, or perlite. Hydroponic production systems are used by small farmers, hobbyists, and commercial enterprises.

                <span class="v1_31">The world is facing many problems nowadays, including a growing number of people living in cities, many of whom often do not have easy access to fresh food. To solve this problem, it is necessary to develop a new kind of agriculture that provides city residents with food security while also protecting the environment. Rooftop agriculture could be a solution. Rooftop agriculture is a type of urban agriculture, in which food is grown on the tops of buildings. Rooftop agriculture can have many benefits. For example, it can reduce the extreme heat in the city during summer, it can help to decrease urban poverty, and it can help people to socialize more.</span></div>
